# Bank-of-England-Analysing-Quarterly-Earnings-Call

# Business Scenario
The Bank of England prudentially regulates and supervises financial services firms through the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The PRA are responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of around 1,500 banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers, and major investment firms.  To achieve this, the PRA examines various data sources, some more accessible than others. Quarterly result announcements are a particularly challenging data source to analyse. Traditional data science methods struggle to fully utilise this type of data because of the following two reasons:

1. They are unstructured in the form of text and/or video/webcasts.
2. They are complex, requiring technical and financial background knowledge.

This project aims to enhance the use of these data sets to improve our risk assessment of individual firms and, in doing so, maintain financial stability.
